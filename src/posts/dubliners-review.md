You expect literature when you read Dubliners. Capital L. Dense, footnoted, seminar-worthy stuff. That's not the case.

Joyce intended for this to serve as a mirror. To trap, to introduce Ireland to itself.
Fifteen short stories. No heroes. No resolutions. Quietly stuck, just people.

The trick is that nothing occurs. In other words, what occurs is what always occurs. You wake up. You leave for work. You become inebriated. You tell yourself lies. You want to get away. You don't.

The remainder of the book is haunted by a line from one of the early stories, which I believe is Eveline:

> "She watched the evening creep into the avenue while she sat at the window."

It's all of it. The passive voice, the gradual suffocation. The waiting for a change, anything at all.

The characters are immobile. Trapped by routine, fear, shame, poverty, and religion. Not frightful, though. simply the apprehension of trying something new.

Joyce also doesn't give a pass. He never gives an explanation. Simply cuts after showing you a scene.

A man meets his successful friend after years of separation, much like in *A Little Cloud*. The friend is published, worldly, and a storyteller. With a baby at home and a quiet office job back in Dublin, the man suddenly realizes that this isn't the life he wanted. He doesn't get angry, though. He merely lets out a sigh. And goes back to it.

Or Araby — a boy develops feelings for a girl. At the bazaar, he intends to purchase a present for her. He shows up after the lights have gone out. He takes nothing with him. That is the entire tale.

You understand, if you've ever had faith in something and then seen it fall apart under fluorescent lights.

I recall one night — years ago — I ran into an old classmate at a convenience store back home. He looked tired. Told me he was already working. Said he was thinking about going back to school, maybe. *"Someday"*, he said. And then he just laughed. Like he already knew he wouldn’t.

That’s Dubliners. That kind of laugh.

It all comes together in the last story, **The Dead**. Gabriel, a man who believes he is intelligent, progressive, and considerate, gradually comes to the realization that he is none of those things. His wife sobs while listening to a song about a long-dead boy she once loved. Gabriel remains silent as he observes her. It's snowing outside. Finally, he senses that it's not jealousy, not even rage. But insignificance.

> “His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe.”

That's the last line. One of the best in literature. Not because it's poetic, but because it lands.

Joyce recognized early on that the truth lies in the silence, something that most people avoid. **Epics aren't what life is all about**. It is composed of unresolved small moments, unspoken emotions, and lost opportunities.

This book doesn't leave you feeling motivated. You feel seen when you're done.

I think that's enough.
