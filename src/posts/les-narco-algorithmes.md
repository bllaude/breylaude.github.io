People reckon drugs these days are pretty hardcore.

LSD, DMT, the stuff that comes out of their minds when they think of
> this is gonna fuck me up in *incredible* ways

But they're wrong, I mean, we havent even begun to peak in terms of fucked-up trippy shit, not until we get into the realm of narco-algorithms.

## Inputs
Currently, the trippiest shit is what messes with your inputs, stuff that makes you hallucinate, stuff that throws off your sense of balance or your reaction times.

Everything today is about how much we can throw out our inputs that we are aware of and thats why no-one is gonna be ready for the era of narco-algorithms.

## Concept Space
Neural networks today operate more or less on the premise of identifying inputs, in a way that **We**, **the Programmer**, don't need to specify the important inputs.

We might create an ai that can detect chairs, because the ai correctly weighted that whenever it sees something that looks like four legs, that's a point in favour of being a chair.

What if we, as a species, were able to edit the corresponding weights in our brains.
