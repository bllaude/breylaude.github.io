There’s this annoying thing I’ve noticed. It happens often enough that I can’t ignore it anymore.

In the Philippines, I know lots of people who think humility is about looking plain. At first, I thought maybe they just love to copy those Chinese business owners in the area.

If you wear something nice — something that fits you well, something you clearly put thought into — it raises eyebrows. You become that person. You get judged without saying a word.

It’s strange.

I always thought humility was about how you treat people. Whether you think you’re better than them. Whether you make space for others. Whether you listen. Not what kind of shoes you’re wearing.

But here, there’s this blurred line. People talk about “being simple” like it’s some kind of fucking virtue. But it’s not about simplicity — it’s about visibility. Don’t stand out too much. Don’t look too polished. Don’t look like you care too much. Because if you do, people might think you’re trying to be above them.

That’s the part that pisses me off.

Because sometimes people just want to wear something they fucking like. Sometimes they put effort on how they look, not for anyone else, but because it makes them feel good. I like good design. I like fabric that moves a certain way. I like how clothes can feel like a kind of quiet art. It’s not performance. It’s just expression.

But the moment you do that, you’re read a certain way. Not based on your actions. Not based on how you treat people. But based on how you look.

## Don't confuse humility with frugality
This is where everything goes to shit.

People confuse humility with frugality. And they confuse frugality with virtue. They’ve tied them together like some fucked-up logic that makes no sense.

But being humble has nothing to do with how much money you spend. It’s not about how old your shirt is, or whether your shoes are scuffed, or if you’ve worn the same hoodie three days in a row. That’s just pure economics.

Humility is a posture. A mindset. It’s about not thinking you're better than anyone, regardless of what you’re wearing. It’s about decentering yourself. Listening more than you talk. Knowing your place in the world isn’t fixed or owed. It’s knowing that at the end of the day, we’re all just people.

Frugality, on the other hand, is a spending choice. A preference. Maybe a necessity. You can be frugal and still be a fucking asshole. You can be extravagant and humble. One doesn’t guarantee the other.

But we’ve wrapped these things together in this weird cultural logic: if you dress simply, you must be good. If you dress well, you must be proud.

It’s lazy thinking. And worse, it makes people feel ashamed for caring about aesthetics, or enjoying art, or simply wanting to feel good in their own skin.

It tells people to shrink. To hide. To tone themselves down in order to be seen as decent.

And that’s not humility. That’s just fear dressed up as virtue.

Honestly, I think it’s even more powerful when someone who looks sharp turns out to be kind. Grounded. Gentle. That’s what really sticks with you — not the clothes, but the contradiction. The surprise. It kinds of reminds us that our instincts to judge are often wrong.

Maybe that’s what I want to say. That we shouldn’t confuse self-expression with ego. That humility isn’t about looking poor. And that sometimes, the best kind of humility is the quiet kind — the kind that doesn’t need to prove anything to anyone, especially not through the way you dress.

I'm in an edgy headspace right now. im sorry for such a shitty armchair psychology article. Back to your regular non-edgy shit at a later time.
