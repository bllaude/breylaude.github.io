It’s weird how long it took me to leave, fucking unbelievable.

Not because I liked it. I didn't have a choice. Not really. But because it had turned itself into the fabric of things. From messaging to checking events, keeping track of people from high school I barely remembered or cared about. Little social habits that didn’t seem worth breaking actually.

I didn’t leave because of another privacy breach. Not even after the weird headlines about internal memos justifying growth at all costs. Those things are unsettling, oui. But I kept scrolling. I rationalized, like most people do. It’s just a fucking website. It’s how I stay in touch. I’ll just tweak my privacy settings.

I knew something was off. But apparently, there's this magnetic force that makes people stay.

That’s what makes **Facebook** so effective — its harms are rarely immediate. They accumulate slowly, like some mild toxin. You don’t notice it at first. Then one day you catch yourself refreshing the news feed with no intention. You realize you’re angrier than you used to be. Mindlessly scrolling like some fucked up zombie.

At first, I blamed Facebook. I don't wanna talk much about Facebook. I moved to Twitter, Twitter is slightly better than Facebook when it comes to communities and keeping up with the latest news in tech - which is basically the only thing I'm interested on keeping tab. But only about that. But then, of course, people suddenly get tired of things for whatever reason, I reckon deleting the app but not the account. I thought just in case I want to keep up with the latest updates, I could check with my laptop - which is far better than on the phone - there's just a different vibe (generally speaking) doing things with the laptop, whether it simply checking the email or whatever, I'm not really sure - maybe because you can't feel the weight of all the shit you do. Then I tried Instagram. Instagram got weird, I don't want to explain but you know what I'm saying. Like Twitter, the account's still there, I just deleted the app. Tried Mastodon. Didn't really took the time to check Threads, you know, funny how the first announcement was already weird, honestly, it needs no checking. Then BlueSky, then whatever was trending next. But never Tiktok.

Point is - each of these platforms promised the same thing: a better, healthier digital space. And unfortunately, each one failed in the same way.

Because it turns out the problem wasn’t the app. The problem was the concept itself — social media as a system, as I call it (SMaS). The frictionless connection, engineered full-scale, monetized through attention, powered by surveillance. Basically a place where everything is seen, but almost nothing is understood, sadly. The more you use it, the worse you feel. At least to me.

### You're Not the User, You're the Product
Every social media platform sells itself as a community. But it's more likely a casino. You go in thinking you’re there to connect with people. But the longer you stay, the more you realize it's the house that always wins — and you’re not holding the cards.

It watches everything. What you click. The duration of your scroll. What you almost typed but didn’t send. What you’re afraid to say. What triggers you. What excites you. What keeps you coming back when you're tired and sad and lonely. 

That data isn’t passive. It’s used to engineer your behavior. Not in some sci-fi dystopian way — but in little things. Slight boosts in visibility. Emotionally charged posts in your feed. Outrage, envy, desire. All tuned not to inform you, but to keep you hooked. That’s not a bug, that's a feature. Or more accurately, a business model. The earlier you learn this, the better.

### Everyone is a Performer
It took me a long time to admit it, it wasn’t that people are faking. It’s just that when you know you're being watched, you start shaping your thoughts to suit the audience. It almost reaches the definition of *"faking"* itself but, as I prefer being kinder and being more understanding nowadays, I'd call it *"people pleasing"* - which sounds a litte bit more tolerable, and easier to cure.

Worse is when you arrive to the point where you create your VERY own imaginary audience. I mean, I'm on a very edgy headspace at the moment, I'll discuss this at a later time. No hate.

I mean, you post/repost something funny, and check back every minute for the reactions. You post something aesthetic, you check every minute for comments. You share an article, and watch for the smart replies. Vent about something, and immediately regret it when it doesn’t land. You start looking at everything through whether it’s postable. Batshit crazy.

Social media turns your interior monologue into a product. Your thoughts become content. And over time, you lose something. Something subtle, but vital for humanity, IMO: 

<pre>The ability to be alone in your own head without broadcasting it.</pre>

I mean, it must be difficult being mediocre.

This isn't me being overly edgy. It’s actually backed by a growing pile of research.


### The Science of Feeling like Shit
Social media use is correlated with increased depression, anxiety, loneliness, and body image issues — especially among younger generation, but not just them. Studies have shown that quitting, even for a few weeks, leads to improved mental health, better sleep, and greater life satisfaction. And the more you use it, the worse it tends to get.

One study found that people who used Facebook more frequently were significantly more likely to report feelings of envy and inadequacy. Another found that simply observing the lives of others online led to measurable decreases in subjective well-being.

Cherry on top? we all know it’s bad for us. And yet we keep coming back.

Why? Because these systems are addictive by design. Not metaphorically. Literally.

Intermittent variable rewards. Social validation loops. Algorithmic dopamine triggers. All of that stuff. It's not a coincidence that these systems feel compulsive. They were engineered by people who studied addiction science. They built slot machines for the soul.

### The Bigger Problem
What's scary isn’t just what social media does to an individual — it’s what it’s doing to all the people, in a collective sense. It’s reshaping how we talk, how we think, how we understand the world. Flattening conversation into discourse. It's rewarding rage over reflection. And it’s making everything feel like a crisis, all the time.

But what would the internet look like if we didn’t have to live like this?

We already have the tools. Decentralized networks. Privacy-respecting protocols. Ways of connecting that don’t depend on surveillance and ad hominem attacks. But we’ve forgotten how to use them. Because we’ve gotten used to the dopamine rush. Basically the easy outrage. People need to relearn how to be bored, I guess.

### Fin
Social media isn’t evil. But it’s not neutral either. It’s a system that incentivizes the worst parts of human behavior — and then sells your reactions to the highest bidder. I didn’t want to keep playing that kind of game. So I left. Simple.

And if that sounds radical, maybe that’s the problem.
