I’m not sure why I picked up **Crime and Punishment**. Maybe it was the algorithm. Maybe it was guilt. Or maybe I was just looking for something old enough not to be trying to sell me anything. Whatever the reason, I didn’t expect it to gut me.

I’ve read my share of *“important”* books. You know the type — long, serious, good for you like kale. You read them so you can say you read them. So you can underline things and post about it and feel clever. Crime and Punishment is different. You don’t read it so much as get dragged through it. It doesn't feel like a novel. It’s an interrogation.

Raskolnikov, a poor, brilliant student in St. Petersburg, decides to murder an old pawnbroker. Not out of desperation, but ideology. He wants to prove he can do it — for the greater good, he tells himself. She’s a parasite, he argues. Think of how many lives could be improved with the money she hoards. Think of what a great man could do if he just stopped worrying about small moral rules.

He does it. Sort of.

We like to think morality is clean. Engineers especially. Rules, tests, assertions. We build systems where every case has a handler, every outcome is deterministic. But real life doesn’t compile. Humans aren’t functions. And morality, real morality, doesn’t live in the logic — it lives in the edge cases. It's in the moment where the code breaks and you’re left staring at the wreckage, wondering who wrote this and why you trusted it.

Raskolnikov is what happens when you live entirely in your own logic. He treats the world like a math problem: if suffering exists and I can eliminate some of it by doing one evil thing, isn’t that a net good? Isn’t that utilitarianism? Or progress? 

Sound familiar? It’s every well-meaning technocrat who believes in breaking things to fix them. Every startup pitch that promises disruption without any clarity on what gets disrupted, or who gets buried in the rubble. Like a data scientist who feeds people into models without asking whether they want to be there.

And honestly, it’s me. I’ve been that person. I’ve made changes to systems because the logic made sense, only to see the people who depended on them get hurt. I’ve optimized without asking who was being optimized for. Raskolnikov isn’t a madman, he's a warning.

What’s truly terrifying in the book isn’t the murder. It’s what comes after. The crushing weight of guilt. The slow realization that ideas, when acted out in the real world, leave blood behind. That abstraction isn’t innocence. That a thought can still kill.

Dostoevsky doesn’t offer a clean answer. There’s no TED Talk revelation, no viral quote you can stick on a slide. What he offers is empathy. He shows you a man who believed in an idea and nearly destroyed himself by following it. And then, somehow, he offers love.

He doesn’t excuse Raskolnikov. But he understands him. And that, more than anything, is the radical part.

Because we live in a world that punishes. Publicly, brutally, algorithmically. It’s easier than understanding. Easier than confronting our own capacity for wrongness. But Dostoevsky suggests something harder and braver: that maybe we don’t need more punishment. We need awakening. The kind that hurts more, that forces you to look in the mirror and ask: What have I done in the name of being right?

The hacker in me kept seeing metaphors. Everything else is userland. You can override functions, patch memory, manipulate processes — but if the kernel’s corrupt, eventually the whole system crashes.

And the only fix? Not code. Not reason, especially not repentance. IMO the fix is something more terrifying: human connection. Raskolnikov is saved, if you can call it that, not by his arguments but by love. Love that doesn’t justify or excuse, but refuses to look away. That’s the thing no rational system can account for.

### Final Verdict
So no, Crime and Punishment isn’t a fun book. It doesn’t make you smarter. It makes you feel stupid, and small, and broken. And somehow, that’s what makes it necessary.

Because in the end, ideas aren’t the problem. Detachment is.

The danger isn’t in thinking too much — it’s in thinking without listening, without humility.

Dostoevsky reminds us that morality isn’t a formula to be cracked. It’s a presence. And if we ever stop feeling haunted, we’ve already lost.
