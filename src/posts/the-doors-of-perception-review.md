Drugs are dangerous, they say. That they deprive you of reality, burn your brain, and dull your senses. Aldous Huxley, however, had no interest in safety. Truth was what he sought. And if that meant taking a pill and sitting motionless on a couch in LA while his mind untangled itself into colorful threads, then so be it.

In addition to being a meditation on consciousness, perception, beauty, and the boundaries of language, *The Doors of Perception* is Huxley's description of a mescaline trip. It's barely more than a pamphlet, but it's explosive. It's like entering someone else's head while they're busy moving furniture around.

Huxley had no intention of getting high. He sought to observe.

> “Each person is at each moment capable of remembering all that has ever happened to him and of perceiving everything that is happening everywhere in the universe.”

In 1953, Huxley took mescaline under supervision, but this was no Hunter S. Thompson or psychedelic party. He approached it with a child's curiosity, and a scientist's seriousness. For hours, he gazed at the folds of his pants and discovered God. Or something similar.

The main idea is that your mind is capable of more than it currently does. However, it doesn't. It is intentionally filtered. Huxley refers to it as a *"reducing valve"*. Evolution chose for survival rather than truth. It's risky to see too much. In order to avoid walking into traffic, we see just enough.

However, the filter lifts under mescaline. Your pants' folds suddenly take on a sacred quality. A vase radiates is-ness. Time slows down. Without the blinders on, you are seeing what is already there; you are not hallucinating.

What if he's right? What if our entire idea of what constitutes *"normal"* experience is akin to attempting to comprehend a novel by reading a single word from each page?

I was reminded of discussions about cognitive liberty when I read Huxley. Who is in charge of your thoughts? Why is it against the law to investigate your own consciousness? Huxley had no intention of running away. His message was to pay attention to what you're not noticing, not to *"take mescaline"*.

He writes as though he were constructing a cathedral of ideas, quoting Cézanne one minute, Meister Eckhart the next, and then abruptly introducing the physiology of the nervous system. Either you stay ahead or you fall behind. But it's worth reading because he believes you'll be able to handle it.

Nevertheless, there are moments of smugness. An elitism from the past. The kind that presumes you've read Plotinus and can tell early Renaissance icons from Byzantine ones. But, that doesn't lessen the impact of the primary message.

That is, the world is more vibrant, intricate, and alive than we allow ourselves to perceive.

In the end, Huxley writes:

> “Love is as much a mode of knowledge as vision or intuition.”

I realize it sounds ambiguous. He is arguing that knowing is more than just measuring. It goes beyond definitions and facts. Awe, stillness, or simply being awake can all be signs of true knowledge.

Perhaps we should open that door.
