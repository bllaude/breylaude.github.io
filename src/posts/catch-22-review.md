I didn't read Catch-22 in high school. I probably wouldn't have liked it if I did.

It's the kind of book you have to read after getting caught up in too many loops, fed up with bureaucracy, and filling out too many forms that led nowhere. It only make sense after you've screamed into the void of *"customer support"* or sat in a meeting where everyone speaks English but nothing actually gets said.

Joseph Heller wrote Catch-22 about war. In actuality, though, he wrote it about life. It is only made more apparent by the war.

On the surface, the story is straightforward: Yossarian, a U.S. bombardier, wants to cease flying missions. Although his fear of dying is reasonable, it is regarded as insanity. The doctors insist that he must be sane if he refuses to fly missions, so they must continue to send him on them. However, they would release him if he were crazy enough to fly them voluntarily. The catch is that. Catch-22.

It's ridiculous. But it's true. Yossarian's reasoning isn't limited to military reasoning. It is the reasoning behind organizations, businesses, governments, and educational institutions. It's the one that advises you to take out student loans in order to find employment and pay them back. The idea that a job is necessary to gain experience and experience is necessary to obtain a job. That although you must work to support yourself, you are too preoccupied with your job to enjoy life.

The rules of the game are made to keep you playing over and over again. And when do you doubt the game? You've been called crazy. There's always a reason why someone is *"unprofessional"*, *"not a team player"* so on. Every time, there's a form that you failed to complete. A rule you were unaware of. A meeting that you ought to have planned. They only make you too exhausted to defend yourself; they don't need to lock you up.

That's why the book is so powerful. It's more than just satire. Heller writes like a man who laughed so he wouldn't scream. The jokes are quick, witty, and absurd. Like sketches from a fever dream, characters appear and disappear. However, there is something gravely serious hidden beneath the mayhem. Humans pass away. Not only from conflict, but also from apathy. Due to incapacity, from unquestioning trust in procedures that prioritize paperwork over people.

No one wants to deal with Major Major, so he gets promoted. Milo Minderbinder bombs his own base to make money and turns war into a business. Everyone claims that they are only doing as they are told. Everyone is merely carrying out their duties. But no one's responsible.

That's the terrible aspect of Catch-22. Not the violence. Not the craziness. But the fact that everything still occurs because no one is in control.

There is no sense of resolution at the end of the book. You complete it with acknowledgment. These are people you've seen. You've worked for them. You've become them.

I wonder, perhaps that's why people continue to read it. Because a part of us still believes that we are not stuck. That if you simply kept your head down, worked a little harder, and discovered the right loophole...But you know, deep down, you’re in the Catch too.
