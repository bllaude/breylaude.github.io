Some people start their day with the goddamn radio. Others wind down with the evening news. Some mindlessly scroll through social media, while others stay *“informed”* by watching YouTube channels like CNN. There are even those who get breaking news alerts blasted straight to their phones like it’s some ritual. And they all seem to agree that keeping up with the news is every citizen’s solemn *f***ing* duty. Everyone, except for me.

Some people kind of share my view — at least halfway. They’ll bash cable news for its obsession with gruesome crimes, its horse-race political bullshit, and its endless stream of PR-flavored garbage. But they still think the system can be fixed. Hell no. Honestly, I don’t think there’s anything left worth saving.

Take today’s New York Times. There's a chart showing a spike in abortions in 2024. Some blip about diplomatic maneuvering. Stocks going down the drain. China's economic stats. Hollywood actors getting a new contract deal.

None of this shit touches my life. Sure, reading it might be enjoyable, but it’s a pointless enjoyable — a nice, smooth, f waste of time. It doesn’t change a damn thing I do.

Most people will nod at this and say, “Okay, fine, but there’s still virtue in knowing.” Like somehow, being constantly plugged into the news stream makes you a better citizen. They’ll preach about newspapers holding power to account—keeping the bastards in check.

Maybe that’s technically true. But here’s what’s funny: I’m never involved. The government f***s up, the news screams about it, people rage-tweet, the government mutters an apology, and then—surprise—they keep doing the same shady shit, just a bit more sneakily. Sure, it’s a cycle. Maybe even a useful one. But, It would probably still work just fine even if no one read a goddamn word of it. It’s a self-sustaining machine.

And then there’s voting. But being an informed voter doesn’t mean marinating in political drama every f***ing day. All you need is a decent voter guide before the election — one that lays out the issues without the noise. No whiplash-inducing scandals, no endless loops of lies and rebuttals. You actually get to think.

Some folks argue, *“But sometimes a news story really changes your life.”* Come on. I mean, how often does that actually happen? The big shifts in life come from deep reading, long essays, thoughtful books — not some 800-word panic piece written under deadline.

Which brings me to another kind of half-agreement: TV critics making fun of the news cycle. You’ve probably heard the it: *“Unconfirmed reports say—Wait! This just in! Those reports are false! No, wait—we’ve got confirmation denying the denial of the original unconfirmed report.”* Yeah, we all laugh. But they still think the solution is just better timing. Like, *“Just wait until it’s confirmed, then run the damn story.”*

Okay, but why stop there? If updates every five minutes are dumb, why not get the news once a day? Or once a week? Or better yet, once a f***ing year? Seriously — would you even miss it?

With the time people waste glued to the goddamn news, they could be reading actual books — getting more depth, more clarity, more meaning. But no, they don’t. Because most of that content is irrelevant trash, and deep down, they know it.

And here’s the part people are most indenial: following the news isn’t just a waste of time. It’s bad for your f***ing brain. Some guy once said reading the New York Times in the morning scrambled his mind so badly he couldn’t do any serious thinking for the rest of the day. Guess what? I believe him.

The news’s obsession with cramming in every damn topic with zero depth leads to a tidalwave of inaccuracy. Just flip to the corrections page — it’s a graveyard of screw-ups. And if you’ve ever been in a news story yourself, you already know: they get it wrong. Always. Their constant crime porn makes us paranoid. The breathless urgency kills reflection. The shallow coverage? It makes us shallow too.

This isn’t just another armchair psychology bullshit — I mean it. I haven’t followed the news since I was 19, except for the rare dip into a topic that actually matters to me. And I’m better for it. Calmer. Clearer. More focused. But I rarely find anyone with the guts to do the same. Most people are too scared to tune out. But maybe well they should.

*“Fuck it, I’m out.”*
