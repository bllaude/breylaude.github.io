If there's one thing I'm good at, it's coming up with half-baked armchair rants to do with why I can't stand working for other people and corporations.

So you know what this blog really needs?

(Design that isn't shit).

(Content that isn't shit).

You guessed it, another half-baked armchair rant

## Work-life balance
Is a meme, pure and simple

You don't go around bragging:

> Ah yes, I actually had a pretty solid getting-bitten-by-snakes-all-day slash applying-antivenom-to-myself balance!

Yet for some reason, having a good balance between living your life and being obligated to perform labor for someone else in order to not die is seen as a good thing?

It really got me thinking about, you know, life and all that and makes me a lil sad fam ngl

The conspiracy nut in me wants to make a statement along the lines of:

<pre>The powers that be purposely impose the current state of late-stage capitalism to keep the Everyperson employed for as long as possible, thereby diminishing their ability to find purpose elsewhere in life.
</pre>

The regular person in me wants to make a statement along the lines of:

<pre>A by-product of our current work-centric culture is that the Everyperson has lost the ability to find meaningful purpose outside of career advancement slash financial goals slash corporate objectives.
</pre>

And finally, the rational part of me wants to make a statement along the lines of:

<pre>The powers that be purposely impose current late-stage capitalism to keep the Everyperson employed for as long as possible / in order to diminish their ability to find purpose elsewhere in life.
</pre>

Honestly, *“work-life balance”* is a weird concept to grasp when most of your *life part* is shaped — if not outright owned — by work. At work, you're (supposedly) not even allowed to do anything for yourself, aside from the tiny sliver of time you're granted to shovel down food or sneak off to the bathroom for a quick doomscroll.

As in, *“with your phone, on the toilet”* not *“with your phone physically placed upon the toilet”* but hey, if thats how you wanna spend your time at work then you have my respect for doing something odd during worktime.

But my actual point, however, is that once you get out of work, you're:

- Tired as fuck
- Obligated to buy and cook food so you don't die
- Obligated to do a bunch of cleaning so you don't turn into a slob
- Obligated to do so much stuff in preparation for the next day

And repeat that for almost three-quarters of the week, until you're given a measly two days to actually live your life.

People are losing their ability to make their own way in the world, and achieve a purpose that isn't related to corporatism or something work-related.

People lose so much of their lives doing something that doesn't further their own purpose on this planet, and for the most part, they dont really think it's a huge problem.

We have made so many incredible advances in technology, yet the Everyperson barely sees any of it, and despite this, people still work more than eight hours/day like they always have (and in some countries, minimum of eight hour/day would be something they would be ecstatic to have).

You need to learn how to actually live again, how to have meaningful goals that aren't related to the corporate power of someone else.

You need to do whatever you can to break the cycle and step into a new age of enlightenment — where we (and I know this sounds wild, but hear me out)

Use our technological advancements to make people's lives easier and more fulfilling, and then we might just be able to learn how to have actual dreams again.
