Hello! My name is Brey Laude, I am a 21-year-old security researcher who enjoys reading books, driving and working on startups. He is generous and giving, but can also be very rude and a bit lazy.

I created a software development agency in 2021, and now run a cybersecurity business called [Laude Technologies](https://laudetechnologies.com) where we build hardware prototypes.
